# SymbioCare - Frontend (Web)

## Project Overview

SymbioCare frontend is built with **React** and provides an interactive and responsive user interface for doctors and patients. The web app allows users to manage appointments, monitor health data, and interact with medical records. It also integrates with wearable devices to track health metrics in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Mantine UI**: A modern UI library for React, providing ready-to-use components like modals, tables, and notifications.
- **React Query**: For efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the backend API.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation between different views in the single-page application.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend REST API.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe language to ensure better scalability and reliability in development.
- **Jest**: Testing framework for unit and integration tests.

## Key Features

### For Doctors:
- **Patient Dashboard**: View a list of patients, including their health data, and create medical reports.
- **Appointment Management**: View, accept, and reject patient appointments, with the ability to set availability.
- **Health Data Visualization**: View patients' health parameters (SpO2, heart rate, weight, etc.) using interactive charts.
- **Medical Reports**: Create and manage medical visit reports for patients.

### For Patients:
- **Health Tracking**: Input and track health parameters such as SpO2, heart rate, and weight manually or via Bluetooth-connected devices.
- **Appointment Booking**: Request appointments by selecting available time slots.
- **Registration via QR Code**: Securely onboard by scanning a QR code generated by a doctor.
- **Medical History**: View past medical visits, health parameters, and other clinical data.
